    inputs    - data, column oriented time series
              - L, maximal lag to which AMI will be calculated
              - bins, number of bins to use in the calculation, if empty an
                adaptive formula will be used
              - to_matlab, an option for MATLAB users of the code, if MATLAB
                datatypes are needed for output, use this to have them
                returned with proper types. Default is false.

                Only use if you have 'matlab.engine' installed in your current
                Python env.
                Note: this cannot be installed through the usual conda or pip
                commands, search online to view resources to help in installing
                'matlab.engine' for Python.
    outputs   - tau, first minimum in the AMI vs lag plot
              - v_AMI, vector of AMI values and associated lags

    inputs    - x, single column array with the same length as y.
              - y, single column array with the same length as x.
    outputs   - ami, the average mutual information between the two arrays
    Remarks
    - This code uses average mutual information to find an appropriate lag
      with which to perform phase space reconstruction. It is based on a
      histogram method of calculating AMI.
    - In the case a value of atu could not be found before L the code will
      automatically re-execute with a higher value of L, and will continue to
      re-execute up to a ceiling value of L.
    Future Work
    - None currently.
    Mar 2015 - Modified by Ben Senderling, email unonbcf@unomaha.edu
              - Modified code to output a plot and notify the user if a value
                of tau could not be found.
    Sep 2015 - Modified by Ben Senderling, email unonbcf@unomaha.edu
              - Previously the number of bins was hard coded at 128. This
                created a large amount of error in calculated AMI value and
                vastly decreased the sensitivity of the calculation to changes
                in lag. The number of bins was replaced with an adaptive
                formula well known in statistics. (Scott 1979
              - The previous plot output was removed.
    Oct 2017 - Modified by Ben Senderling, email unonbcf@unomaha.edu
              - Added print commands to display progress.
    May 2019 - Modified by Ben Senderling, email unonbcf@unomaha.edu
              - In cases where L was not high enough to find a minimun the
                code would reexecute with a higher L, and the binned data.
                This second part is incorrect and was corrected by using
                data2.
              - The reexecution part did not have the correct input
                parameters.

  Future Work
  - Currently there are two methods of detecting a minimal percentage of

    percentage, the other looks for a limit. Currently only dim is
    returned. This code can be modified to use a comprimise of the two.
  Prior - Created by someone
  Feb 2015 - Modified by Ben Senderling, email: unonbcf@unomaha.edu
             No changes were made to the algorithm. Checks were added to
             provide information to the user in case of an error. The two
             methods described in future work were also modified to work
             cooperatively. In a previous version the second method (dim)
             overwrote the first method (dim2).
  Sep 2015 - Modified by Ben Senderling, email: unonbcf@unomaha.edu
             Previously, dim was found after the for loop, this version has
             been modified to allow the code to find the minimum as it
             calculates FNN. This is set within the inputs.
             The check that was previously put in has been commented out.
  Oct 2015 - Modified by John McCamley, email: unonbcf@unomaha.edu
           - Embedded other required functions as subroutines.
  Mar 2017 - Modified by Ben Senderling, email: unonbcf@unomaha.edu
           - Removed global variables in favor of passing the variables
             from function to function directly. This significantly
             improved performance. Checked that the calculated percentages
             of nearest neighbors are the same as the previous version.
  May 2020 - Modified by Ben Senderling, bmchnonan@unomaha.edu
           - Added if statement checkeding data orientation.
  Jul 2020 - Modified by Ben Senderling, bmchnonan@unomaha.edu
           - Changed indexing throughout so the input data array doesn't
             need to be reoriented. Changing this sped the code up an
             average 11% on 10 test signals.
           - Removed a couple small for loops and replaced with indexed
             operations. Was also able to remove within function and
             replaced with a single line of code.
           - Removed perviously commented out lines of code that were no
             longer used.

  Remarks
  - Search a kd_tree to find the nearest matches to the global variable
    yq, a vector.  The nearest matches will be put in the global variable
    pqr, and their distances in pqd.  See loclin_kd for a usage example.
  - pqd: Starts as an 1x2 with [inf, inf], then it is added to with the values from dist.
    If pqd is longer than m_search, then only the values up to m_search are kept.
  - pqr: Starts as an empty array, then the data from y_model is added with the bounds
    defined by yi which is also defined by node_list. Then the last two data points are
    kept just like with pqd.
  - pqz: The same concept as pqr, except it is using data from the z_model.
  - index: Records the indices that are to be traversed to create the sorted order for pqd.
    This is used later on for pqr & pqz to order those to arrays by the order defined by index.

  Future Work
  - This code could be commmented to be understood easier.
